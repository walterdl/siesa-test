# siesa-test

Solution to a technical hiring test for the software developer position.

The test consisted of developing both the front and the back for an online store. The functionalities presented by this system are:

- CRUD of products, where each product consists of a name, description, price and an optional discount applicable for a time range.
- List of products with the detail of the cost and discount of each product, along with option to add to the shopping cart.
- Filter in the list of products by range of discount applicability dates.
- Opci√≥n para ordenar la lista de productos de manera ascendente o desdentente por el valor del descuento de producto.
- Management of the shopping cart, allowing to add / remove products from the shopping cart.
- Payment gateway simulation, where the user confirms the shopping cart and enters their credit card details.

The system was developed with `Angular 8`, `[Yii2 Framework](https://www.yiiframework.com/)`, `MySQL`, `NodeJS` with `TypeScript`, and `MongoDB`.
